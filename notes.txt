notes:

Unusual fields:
grid can come from ONE layer and ONE plot.  OR rather it's a 'separate' plot? referencing the other data? fie!

data can be a table or a name - which borrows from another layer?

layers are named (or numbered?)

structure is per layer
aes is per layer

simplification is carried out either in server or in client, or via a special simplified server call

stats?

labels is BOTH at the plot and layer level - x and y should be global, but color may be by layer (e.g. a red point is a distinct idea from rainbow of lines, and will have separate legends?)  If color is at the global layer then ONE legend is present.

onZoom is global

onBrush is ... global but local if it needs to extract a property of the data point rather than just the axis (maybe)

scales is global (for sure)!

name is global AND local

geom is local for sure

Xcluster aesthetic has to be the SAME across all layers
